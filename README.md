## Getting Started

There is a .tool-versions file provided. If you don't use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) then please make sure you use `nodejs 16.10.0` and `yarn 1.22.17`.

First, install packages using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will make sure that the correct postcss version is installed.
If you run `npm install` instead you run the chance that the wrong postcss version is installed.

Second, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

or, run the storybook server:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the result.
